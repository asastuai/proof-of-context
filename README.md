## What is in this repository

This repository hosts the Proof of Context family of papers — a small body of work that proposes attestation-based verification primitives for decentralized machine learning settings, framed as a complement to (not a replacement for) cryptographic proof systems like zkML.

The family currently includes two papers:

### Proof of Context (v0.6) — the framework paper

The original position paper. Names the gap in decentralized-ML protocols where computations are verified for correctness but not for *contextual freshness*: was the right model used, on the right input, against the right state, and was the result settled before that context drifted? Introduces four freshness dimensions (computational, model, input, settlement), the execution-context-root construction, and the triple-anchor timestamp. Maps the structural analogue to DeFi's oracle-freshness problem (2020-2024).

- **Paper (Markdown):** [paper/proof-of-context.md](paper/proof-of-context.md)
- **Paper (PDF):** [paper/proof-of-context.pdf](paper/proof-of-context.pdf)
- **Reference implementation (Phase 2):** [proof-of-context-impl](https://github.com/asastuai/proof-of-context-impl) — Rust crate with real cryptography (SHA-256 Merkle, Ed25519, MockCommitter, MockSettlementGate, end-to-end integration tests).
- **Status:** v0.6, public-share-ready since April 2026.

### Proof of Context applied to Verifiable Inference (v0.1) — first applied paper

A specialization of the v0.6 framework to commercial inference-as-a-service. Proposes a receipt-based dispute layer over TEE-attested inference. The central finding is that v0.6's four freshness dimensions do not preserve symmetrically when specialized to inference — one collapses, one renames, one new dimension emerges — and the resulting four dimensions partition asymmetrically (1-vs-3) by detection mode in a way that is itself the central conceptual contribution.

- **Abstract:** [paper-poc-inference-v0.1-abstract.md](paper-poc-inference-v0.1-abstract.md)
- **Paper draft (working):** [paper-poc-inference-v0.1-pre1.md](paper-poc-inference-v0.1-pre1.md) — heart sections (§4 Four Dimensions, §5 Inference Receipt, §6 Threat Model) complete; surrounding sections forthcoming.
- **Outline:** [paper-poc-inference-v0.1-outline.md](paper-poc-inference-v0.1-outline.md)
- **Construction process:** [CASE-V0.7-EXTENSION.md](CASE-V0.7-EXTENSION.md) — complete record of the seven rounds of adversarial review that produced the heart sections.
- **Companion benchmark:** [qwen-cloud-benchmark](https://github.com/asastuai/qwen-cloud-benchmark) — Qwen3 14B local-tier baseline complete; cloud sweep pending.
- **Companion crate (forthcoming):** Phase 3 of [proof-of-context-impl](https://github.com/asastuai/proof-of-context-impl) will implement the InferenceReceipt module.
- **Status:** v0.1 working draft published 2026-04-27; remaining sections in active writing.

## How to read this work

If you want the full framework: read **v0.6** first ([paper/proof-of-context.md](paper/proof-of-context.md)). It is a complete position paper.

If you are interested in commercial inference attestation specifically: read the **v0.1 abstract** plus **§4-§6 of v0.1** ([paper-poc-inference-v0.1-pre1.md](paper-poc-inference-v0.1-pre1.md)). These three sections present the complete conceptual contribution. The surrounding sections (introduction, background, problem statement, implementation, empirical illustration, limitations, future work, conclusion) are scaffolded in the outline and will populate in subsequent revisions.

If you are curious about *how* a paper at this scope is built using AI-assisted adversarial review: read **CASE-V0.7-EXTENSION.md**. It documents the seven rounds of review, what each round caught, what was accepted vs pushed back on, and the self-check protocol (bidirectional mapping + outline-consistency + cardinality scan) that emerged from the process.

## Status of the program

This is independent research, conducted by a single author from Buenos Aires, in collaboration with AI tools (Claude Opus, Anthropic) used as adversarial reviewers and writing partners. The methodology of that collaboration is itself part of the public artifact — see [CASE-V0.7-EXTENSION.md](CASE-V0.7-EXTENSION.md) for the working record.

Issues, corrections, replication reports, and co-authorship inquiries are welcome via GitHub Issues or direct contact.
